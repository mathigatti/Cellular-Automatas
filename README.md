# Cellular Automata Classification
Some time ago I created a [small script](https://gist.github.com/mathigatti/439a0e81556f2698c7db4f41189d201f) to convert numbers into automata rules which generate different patterns. Using this I can try generating an infinite number of different patterns, the problem is that most of them are not really intereseting and I have not time to check them one by one. That's why here I try to automatize the process of finding out the intereseting cellular automatas.

## Clusterization
Cellular automata patterns are clusterized based on features related to beauty such as fractal dimensionality and compression efficiency.

### Cluster Examples

#### Cluster 0: Automata patterns without complexity
